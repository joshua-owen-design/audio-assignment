Hi Rocco,

So for the assignment I made some karaoke of some of the songs I listened to most this year. 

I started with making a home page for the 4 songs that you can click to bring up their own page.

I started with the one of the furthest left, Texas Sun.
    I made it so that the song plays at the same time as the karaoke starts when you press the "Play Song" button.
I then did the the third from the left, Limbo.
    I made this one to show four lines at a time instead of two.
    While making this one I realized I made a potentially very costly mistake.
        If I wanted to change the white background behind the lyrics it would have taken me forever, because I would have to go back and fix an insane amount of code.
The lyrics work out with the timing of the lines changes for both these songs, I can assure you of that if you don't want to sit through the whole song haha.

I moved on to the album furthest on the right, Happy Thoughts.
    In the js file "happyThoughts.js" I fixed the code so that if I needed to change one of the background colours, it would be way more effiencient. But I haven't set up the actual song yet.

Overall, making this was very time consuming because of how I set up the setTimeout functions. I didn't know how to make it so that I could skip forward into the song/code, so I had to listen to the whole song to get the timing right to switch lines. There must be a better way.

Also I realized I have both the song playing and starting the karaoke as the same button in the event listeners. However, I can pause the song using the same button, but this would make it so that the karaoke restarted. I haven't figured out how to fix that yet.

Lastly, it was my original plan to record audio and then have another button that would play back the song with your voice recording at the same time. I haven't had a chance to get to that point yet, but hopefully I can figure it out before Sunday night.

Actually I just realized I used Camel casing instead of kabob for a lot of my code. My mistake!

UPDATE: I was about to hand this in when I re-read the outline. I missed the part that said I couldn't use music I don't have the rights to. This was my mistake. I commented out the parts that had the audio I shoudn't be using. This is why I have to use the song "Yankee Doodle" because it was the only royalty free song I could find with lyrics. (In case you were wondering, I don't actually just listen to that) I got the music from Youtube's audio library, it said attribution not required.
